This directory contains the scripts used to estimate nucleotide diversity (pi) and process and plot the output
A job script (for unix environment) was created for each sub population (e.g., RunPi_windowed_POP_1.1) that generates bootstrapped estimates of pi
CreateBoxPlots_pi.R and Plot_pi_geographically.R were used to plot the output (bootstrapped estimates)
