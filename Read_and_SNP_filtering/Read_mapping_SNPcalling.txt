## All jobs were submitted in unix environment

## Reads were mapped to the P. rapae genome while adding read groups using the script: (the script was submitted in sections as separate jobs to speed run times)
qsub RunBWA_RG

## Variants were called using GenomeAnalysisTK-3.8-0-ge9d806836 using the script:(that calls on associated files found in this directory) 
qsub RunHaplotypeCaller_WDL

## g.vcf output files were then combined using the scripts:
qsub RunCombineGVCFs_batch1
qsub RunCombineGVCFs_batch2
qsub RunCombineGVCFs_batch3
qsub RunCombineGVCFs_batch4
qsub RunCombineGVCFs_batch5
qsub RunCombineGVCFs_batch6
qsub RunCombineGVCFs_batch7
qsub RunCombineGVCFs_batch8
qsub RunCombineGVCFs_batch9
qsub RunCombineGVCFs_batch10
qsub RunCombineGVCFs_batch11
qsub RunCombineGVCFs_batch12
qsub RunCombineGVCFs_batch13
qsub RunCombineGVCFs_batch14

## Genotypes were then called with script:
qsub RunGenotypeGVCFs
